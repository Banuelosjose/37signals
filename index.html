			<h3>Useful is forever</h3>
			<p>
			Bells and whistle wear off, but usefulness never does. We builld software that does just what you need and nothing you don't.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>2</h2>
			<h3>Great service is everything</h3>
			<p>
			We're famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day. See how our customers rate our service.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>3</h2>
			<h3>Clarity is king</h3>
			<p>
			Buzzwords, lingo, and sensational sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>4</h2>
			<h3>Our Customers are our investors</h3>
			<p>
			Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them - not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.	
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="column-end">
		<div>
			<h2>5</h2>
			<h3>The basics are beautiful</h3>
			<p>
			We'll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer's time, money, and trust.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>6</h2>
			<h3>No hidden fees or secret prices</h3>
			<p>
			We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>7</h2>
			<h3>Software should be easy</h3>
			<p>
			Our products are intuitive. You'll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don't sell you training because you don't need it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2>8</h2>
			<h3>Long-term contracts are obscene</h3>
			<p>No one likes being locked into something they don't want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either</p>
